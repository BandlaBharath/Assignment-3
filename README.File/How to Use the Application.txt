How to Use the Application:

1.Run the Application: Run the Python script provided in your terminal or code editor to start the application.

#python your_script.py

2.Application Interface: The GUI window will appear, featuring the     following components:

-Input Text Area: Enter the English text you want to translate in this text area.
-Translate Button: Click this button to initiate the translation process.
-Output Text Area: The translated text in Hindi will be displayed in this area.

3.Translation Process:

-The application splits the input text into sentences based on periods (".") and then further divides each sentence into words.
-For each word, it checks if the word exists in the "exclusions" list. If it's in the list, the word is kept as-is and not translated.
-If the word is not in the exclusions list, it is translated from English to Hindi using the Google Translate API.
-Finally, the translated sentences are combined, and the translated text is displayed in the output text area.

4.Exclusions List: You can customize the list of words, phrases, or objects to exclude from translation by modifying the "exclusions" list in the script. This is useful for preserving specific terms that shouldn't be translated.
