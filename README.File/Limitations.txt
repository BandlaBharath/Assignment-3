Limitations:


-The translation quality relies on the Google Translate API, which may not always provide perfect translations, especially for complex or context-dependent sentences.
-The application splits sentences based on periods (".") and doesn't consider other punctuation marks or context.
-Translation might not always be accurate, especially for specialized terms or idiomatic expressions.
